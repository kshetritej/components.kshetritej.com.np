# Introduction
Manually designed and developed UI components for my own use.

## Why?
I'm a developer and when building UIs I often find myself needing to use the same components over and over again. I wanted to create a central place to store these components so that I can easily reuse them in my projects.

## How?
These components are to be used with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. Frequently they will be used with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and dependencies around it.
